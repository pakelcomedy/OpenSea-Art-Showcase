Examples of hot rods based on the Ford Model A:

Russell Lowe's hot rod. The car is based on a frame from a Ford F-250 pickup truck. The body of the Ford Model A was complemented by the V12 Rover Meteor engine from the British Centurion tank. The engine capacity is 27 liters, it was supplemented with two Dominator carburettors and a 16-71 drive supercharger with a working pressure of six bar. In total, the engine produced 1000-1200 horsepower. 
Jimmy Herwethen's hot rod. Almost all the work was done manually. A chassis with a 104-inch wheelbase was prepared. The frame was expanded by 3 inches and received a 10-inch height change at the rear. The project used springs and longitudinal suspension arms from Ford '36 in conjunction with the Winters rear axle and John's Industries 9-inch finned drum brakes made of aluminum. 
Hot rod "Marauder". The body is a model of a 1929 Ford pickup truck. The chassis of the car was custom-made, reinforced and reinforced in eight places. The front part of the new Mustang has been adapted for pneumatic cylinders, and the rear axle is a Mustang 8.8 with 31 slots with a highâ€”friction differential, 4 longitudinal levers and a Panar thrust.
