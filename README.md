How many things have you saved to your favorites — recipes, workouts, articles, ideas, techniques, videos, books…? All those things that once inspired you, only to be left sitting in a *“someday”* folder. And let’s be honest — *“someday”* often turns into *“never.”*

**Project "What If ..?"** is a space for those who are ready to stop postponing and start trying.\
What if today you finally cook that saved recipe? Or try that breathing exercise? Open the book that’s been waiting?\
What if you just… give it a shot?

This club isn’t about pressure or perfection — there’s **no obligation**, just gentle motivation and a supportive atmosphere. Whether you want to have fun and play around with your ideas, or you're ready for a full-on adventure using agile-style sprints to make real progress — this is the place for you.

And if you try something and decide it’s not for you? That’s okay. You’re not alone.

**Ask yourself: "What if?" — and let’s find out what happens.**

👋 About Me

**Hi, I’m Marina.**\
I’m an art therapist, a beginner writer, and I spent a third of my life in marketing. I’m deeply in love with books — our home library has over **11,000** of them.\
Right now, I’m exploring the world of **Web3**, building new projects, and constantly learning.\
But for most of my life, I’ve also been trying to prove something — to the world, and to myself.

I live with **ADHD** and **anxiety**, which means every system I use has to be practical, sustainable, and kind. Over the past 4+ years, I’ve studied everything from **time management** to **soft skills**, from **goal-setting** to **agile thinking**, and tested dozens of habit-building strategies.

Still, I had a box full of ideas, dreams, and “maybe someday” plans gathering dust.

This year, I asked myself: **What if I stop waiting and start trying?**

Now I’m inviting you to ask the same question.\
Let’s find out — together — **what if..?**</details> | <details><summary>Link</summary>[Project "What If ..?"](https://opensea.io/collection/project-what-if)</details> |
