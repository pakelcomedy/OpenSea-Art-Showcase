Art By Ape is a collection of 2222 Artworks paying tribute to his work.

Each piece sourced and respectfully modified ONE BY ONE (no Ai) by @kryptomatyo to create a full collection.

Dali and Picasso were holders of his Art in their time. 

Recently some were sold over $25.000 each.
While modern and eye catching, his creations are powerful and let the viewer with many questions regarding the origins of Art itself.

I hope you enjoy the Art.
