The masked elite gather under flickering chandeliers, their 2.56 ETH entry fee a mere trinket—loose change in the velvet-lined pockets of digital nobility. They whisper in hushed tones about art, community, and the spirit of creation. But let’s be real: the price of admission was the real masterpiece.

And us?

We watch from the outside, not by choice, but by design. The unmasked. The uninvited. The ones whose art lives off-chain, in the margins, in the streets, in the back alleys of the blockchain where the forgotten build their own worlds.

But here’s the punchline—while they trade masks like relics, we’ve got something real. A tangible 8"x8” printed on Hahnemuhle German Etching paper , pressed into existence on the Shape Network. Proof that we don’t need permission to be part of the story.

This isn’t a consolation prize. It’s an invitation to the other masquerade—the one where we don’t need a key, because we make our own doors.

Wear your outsider status like a mask.
Sign your name in the margins.
Crash the party.

Started out as a study to create Dan Flashes complex pattern shirts from the show I Think You Should Leave. Wanted to have a Zancan-esque animated drawing piece. Very happy with how it came out and look forward to dropping as my first series on shape.
Thanks to Nat and the team at Highlight for helping with my code!</details> | <details><summary>Link</summary>[ShapeForge](https://opensea.io/collection/shapeforge)</details> |
