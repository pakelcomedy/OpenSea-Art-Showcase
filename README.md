These rare birds are among the largest freshwater species and are classified as Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Through several expeditions, I documented their grace in flight, peaceful moments on water, and impressive wingspans. The collection showcases stages of their developmentâ€”from eggs and chicks to fully grown adults. Each photo captures the untamed beauty and fragile existence of these birds.

This collection offers a rare glimpse into their world and serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving our natural heritage. Pelecanus Crispus is not just a collection, but a call to appreciate and protect the wild beauty that thrives around us.
