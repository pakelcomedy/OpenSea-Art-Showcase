Light and shadow both contribute equally to life. Light brings joy, shadow protection. Window shutters and shade structures are an ever present sign of light, providing shelter and painting inspiring patterns over the life it protects. Shadows can't be seen without light, light can't exist without shadow. Sea life in the Mediterranean can't exist without its endemic Posidonia Oceanica: protects the coastline from erosion & is home to many animal and plant organisms that find food and protection in the meadows. This series employs minimal elements of my personal story in the Mediterranean. Notably, Posidonia Oceanica, traditional houses from Almer√≠a and also present along the coast east & west, brise soleils and boats.

The Mediterranean is also life and death. Migrants seek hope/light crossing in inhumane conditions the sea, only to find themselves all too often caught forever in the shadow/dying. Some pieces reflect this tragedy through the piercing of the elements, or red in the water. Sometimes a shadow of a person can be seen, but not the person.

This project will donate 25% of my proceedings to both NGOs that help people in this situation and also others that work towards the preservation of the Mediterranean marine ecosystem, through a fund set up in Endaoment.org. Final NGOs still not selected at the time of minting the collection.
