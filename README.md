As luck would have it, a storm rolled in while i was in bed. Thunder woke me. I ran downstairs and grabbed the camera, headed outside on the deck and started snapping. I wasn't 100% sure what to set, just started snapping and adjusting my settings. The storm faded as quickly as it arrived. Upon viewing my shots,I found that the very first click (accidental while getting it on the tripod) caught this. :)</details> | <details><summary>Link</summary>[First Bolt](https://opensea.io/collection/first-bolt)</details> |
