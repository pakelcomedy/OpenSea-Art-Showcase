I am a nur...</summary>My name is Theresa. I am a nurse and I have a certificate in nutrition and a certificate for being a health coach. Just because my interest is in medicine and nutrition doesn’t mean I haven’t had to struggle on both accounts in my life. One of the hardest experiences I have encountered has been getting my lupus diagnosis. It took years to get the right diagnosis and there was such a mental strain to get through the journey. I know this is nothing new for anyone that suffers with an autoimmune disease. There are so many people out there that have had to traverse similar journeys. I am a firm believer in learning something from every experience, whether it’s good or bad. I have learned many things in my life but I never knew the strength I had inside of me to push through.

I am a very introverted person, especially around new people. Crowds make me uncomfortable so I’d much rather be at home in my own home environment. Doing something like this where I am sharing me experience with other people is both terrifying to me and it’s also cathartic and I’m hoping that there is someone out there that can find some comfort in knowing that there is someone else out there that has gone through something similar to them. I know that every person’s journey in life is different, that we all carry our own burdens whether it’s something you can see or not, we all suffer through something and sometimes those bigger events can change who we are.
