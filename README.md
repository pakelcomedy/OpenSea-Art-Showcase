In the book, he talked about the days he spent with an old elephant. He called Ravi the “Sage of the Forest.” Those who read it said that this story was not just about the friendship of an elephant and a traveler, but also a lesson in the transience of life and the deep bonds in quiet moments. Ravi, on the other hand, wandered peacefully in that forest until his last days. Perhaps remembering Arjun’s stories, or perhaps simply listening to the song of the wind.
