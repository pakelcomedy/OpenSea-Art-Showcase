TEP60 is a passenger six—axle diesel locomotive with direct current electric transmission, produced in the USSR at the Kolomna Locomotive Plant from 1960 to 1987. 

It was produced in two versions — single-section and two-section. A total of 1,241 single-section TEP60 diesel locomotives and 116 two-section 2TEP60 locomotives were built. 

During the 1970s and 1980s, TEP60 locomotives were the main passenger locomotives on the railways of the USSR, but then they began to be decommissioned. 

For its time, the TEP60 was the fastest diesel locomotive in the world, with a speed of 193 km/h.</details> | <details><summary>Link</summary>[TEP60 is a passenger six—axle diesel locomotive](https://opensea.io/collection/tep60-is-a-passenger-six-axle-diesel-locomotive)</details> |
