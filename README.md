Through a set of algorithmically generated psycho-geographic maps, the series explores the tension between the chaotic nature of reality and our simultaneous grasping for control. We plan out our lives, weaving intricate, fictitious structures that we try to inhabit, only to get repeatedly blindsided by chance, disorder, degeneration and eventual disintegration.

Drawing on inspiration from scientific diagrams, urban plans and neuronal mappings, the underlying algorithm produces a set of 128 visual poems. All the available iterations have been hand-picked by the artist from a set of more than 6.000 randomly generated seeds.

Token holders can order a corresponding pen plot for an additional fee equivalent to the mint price (more information to follow)

This project is part of the digital section of Cure³ at Bonhams, curated by Alex Estorick and Foteini Valeonti of reGEN.</details> | <details><summary>Link</summary>[Losing Oneself](https://opensea.io/collection/losing-oneself)</details> |
