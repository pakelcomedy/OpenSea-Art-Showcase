| **<details><summary>Echoes of the Ancient</summary></details>** | ![Image](https://i.seadn.io/s/raw/files/9edf1ea70e9407c3f28f9d61333e54bd.png?w=500&auto=format?w=200&auto=format) | One painting whispers a stark truth: We are like isolated islands, adrift in the vast sea of fate. Another unveils a harsher reality: Human encounters, the collisions of these lonely islands, leave indelible scars. We may forge connections, bound by interest, kinship, or even love and hate. But ultimately, the tides pull us apart, each island destined for a solitary path, perhaps even towards destruction. 
But remember, even though weâ€™re like isolated islands, our interactions can leave lasting ripples in the vast ocean of existence. 
Inspired by one of my favourite novel "Gu Daoist Master". | <details><summary>Link</summary>[Echoes of the Ancient](https://opensea.io/collection/echoes-of-the-ancient)</details> |
