Read on about GM Farcaster hypersub and sponsorships:

GM Farcaster fills three important needs for Farcaster's continued and sustained growth: culture, education, and connection. While Dan and Varun rightfully focus on developers to create novel applications on their way to finding product market fit, the rest of us are empowered to build the culture we want to see in the world. (Did Gandhi say that?) As the only Farcaster news show, we are not just providing a useful service, we're protecting the Farcaster scenius and culture of creatives - one built around idealists who don't just talk about a decentralized future but are taking action to create it.

For almost two years, we have live streamed 3x a week, week after week, and have already put out 235 episodes (and counting). Plus bonus episodes including interviews from Eth Denver and FarCon. We have a loyal and steadily growing audience. We have received rave reviews and castimonials. We are continuing to build and love having you with us on this journey!</details> | <details><summary>Link</summary>[Cup o' GMFC](https://opensea.io/collection/cup-o-gmfc)</details> |
