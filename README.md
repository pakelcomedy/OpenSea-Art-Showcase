Each unique Greedy Goblin comes with a unique name, style, & background!
*  These goblins live in the mountains in a land called Erondale (A'-ron-dale). Inside this land are humans, orcs, dwarves, elves, & of course, the greedy little goblins! (Little; except for the soldier goblins).
* The Goblins are notoriously lazy creatures; slobbish even! They hate to work for their bit; & so it is; they are in constant conflict with the other inhabitants of Erondale!
* This is Squint (Sqwin-tuh); he is a sniper & rifleman; he has the best shot of any of the Goblins, although he is from the Greedy Glubnar; aka Glubnard Tribe!
* Holding Grimwort with any Goblin sapper gains advantages mentioned in the nft guide mint; +50% to POWER, & +25% to SPEED!
* Squint has a brother; Grimwort.  Grimwort is an engineer & explosives expert; together they gain +25% to ALL!  (Squint; Greedy Goblin #33)
* Greedy Goblin Character cards; (over 50+ goblin cards in the starting deck); are all designed to be special cards!
* Special Goblins can be played in combination with other 'Specials' to create unique strategies! 
* When paired with Common Goblin cards they can build much larger raiding parties!
* Greedy Goblins conduct many raids on the neighboring villages; & even OTHER goblins...they are insatiable, GREEDY Goblins!
* There are over 50+ Greedy Goblins in this exclusive collection! From commoners, to soldiers, politicians, diplomats, & the rarest; the royal goblins!
* These Greedy Goblins were designed to be integrated into a digital nft fard game; future launch to be announced at my X page @AlphaDoge12üê¶ Thanks for supporting my art! Lots to come; BitSwagger aka Anthony, https://rarible.com/bitswagger, & OpenSea</details> | <details><summary>Link</summary>[Greedy Goblins 33](https://opensea.io/collection/greedy-goblins-33)</details> |
