Her ivory gown, adorned with intricate lace, blends seamlessly with the ethereal white branches that rise above her head, forming a delicate crown of blossoms. The branches, like skeletal fingers reaching towards the sky, are adorned with papery white flowers, their petals unfurling in a silent dance of surrender.

She is a vision of stillness amidst the gentle chaos of nature's awakening.  Her hands, resting gracefully in her lap, are the only sign of life, a subtle reminder of the quiet strength that resides within her.  The delicate porcelain swan, perched on a branch nearby, seems to echo her stillness, its head tilted in a contemplative pose. The air hangs heavy with the promise of a new beginning, a world where beauty and serenity reign supreme. - MIYAMOTO</details> | <details><summary>Link</summary>[MIYAMOTO #001](https://opensea.io/collection/miyamoto-001)</details> |
