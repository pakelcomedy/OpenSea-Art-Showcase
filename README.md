In mathematics, a fractal is a geometric shape containing detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales, often with a fractal dimension that strictly exceeds the topological dimension. Many fractals look similar at various scales, as shown in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. The display of similar patterns at progressively smaller scales is called self-similarity, also known as extending symmetry or unfolding symmetry. The reason I created this story is that I have always been afraid of math and its mysteries, but incredibly, I have had a lifelong interest in geometry and the wonders it creates.
