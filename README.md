Set against the backdrop of America in the 1930s, the work revisits the farmers’ stoic gaze, offering a fresh perspective on their reality and struggles.

At the heart of this evolution lies the wolf—a symbol of the alien, the untamed, and the reflective. It stands as a contrast to humanistic elements, provoking thoughts on coexistence and identity. The addition of punk aesthetics brings a modern twist, blending rebellion and individuality into the piece. These symbols represent a collective spirit, a fight for values that resonate with today’s world.

The rain, drenching the scene, sets the tone for introspection. It suggests that, like the characters in the artwork, we are all caught in the downpour, navigating through life’s challenges soaked yet enduring. Amidst the layers of meaning, the couple remains a centerpiece—a timeless symbol of partnership, connection, and mystery.

With its rich narrative and multi-dimensional exploration, IGNIS—II invites viewers to reflect on the intersections of tradition, rebellion, and the human condition.
