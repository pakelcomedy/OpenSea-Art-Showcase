This collection explores the intersection of the natural and the artificial, where the owl’s gleaming brass feathers and glowing eyes, which double as powerful spotlights, survey the streets below. Each image captures a moment in this dystopian city, where the owl is both protector and sentinel, its gaze a reminder of the ceaseless march of progress. Through the lens of Romanticism, these scenes are bathed in the warm, amber glow of gas lamps and the cool, electric blue of the owl’s eyes, blending the old with the new in a dance of light and shadow. The collection delves into themes of surveillance, the loss of nature in an industrial world, and the haunting beauty of a city that never sleeps.</details> | <details><summary>Link</summary>[Steampunk Owl in the Technocity](https://opensea.io/collection/steampunk-owl-in-the-technocity)</details> |
