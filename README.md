By using the NFT as a certificate of authenticity, Logan-Miles expresses the desire that both the tangible artwork and its digital counterparts remain linked. This approach secures the integrity of the piece, making it traceable and providing peace of mind to the buyer. 

Upon purchase of "Jerry SaltZ" the buyer agrees that the NFT must be transferred alongside if sold—and vice versa: when"Jerry SaltZ" NFT is sold, the tangible artwork must be included. Shipping of the physical piece is NOT covered in the NFT agreement and must be handled between the buyer and purchaser, honoring the intention that this full experience stays together, as intended by The Heart Hatter.

While not guaranteed, it is respectfully requested that both the physical and digital stay united—preserving the soul of the collection. 

** (Shipping is NOT included for the tangible items that are included with each NFT purchase in this contract) ** 

     - Buyer and seller need to coordinate VERY CAREFULLY once any art has been purchased. The PURCHASER is responsible for hiring an insured professional art packing/shipping company. The Purchaser is also responsible for any extra costs related to shipping such as materials, storage, or extra holding.

1. Complete the Transaction:
	•	Confirm your purchase and complete the payment through your digital wallet. The cost will include the artwork price - SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED.
2. Ownership Transfer:
	•	Upon payment, the NFT (representing ownership of the physical artwork) will be transferred to your digital wallet, marking the official transfer of ownership.
Arranging for Shipment
3. Coordinate with the Seller:
	•	After the purchase, contact the seller (or artist) to arrange for the shipment of the physical artwork. This process often resembles traditional art buying, where logistics are discussed post-purchase.
4. Provide Shipping Details:
	•	Provide your preferred shipping method, include any specific instructions. It’s crucial to ensure that these details are accurate for safe delivery.
5. Track and Receive:
	•	Once shipped, the seller should provide you with tracking information. Upon arrival, you’ll have the joy of receiving the physical artwork, accompanied by its digital counterpart in your wallet.

** It is important to note that while the NFT includes the digital assets, the buyer will not receive full rights to the music or the poem. This is more than an NFT drop or a work of art—it is a world-changing experience that touches on the eternal truths of life, inviting those who acquire it to witness the powerful fusion of past and future, art and prophecy, vision and reality.
