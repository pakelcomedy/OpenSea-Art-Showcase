Each piece in the collection reimagines iconic Banksy-inspired street art by replacing traditional elements with the futuristic ZORA Zorb, symbolizing the intersection of art, technology, and decentralized culture.

In this collection, timeless images of human emotion, protest, and social commentary are infused with crypto symbols, creating a bridge between past artistic revolutions and the present-day crypto renaissance. The ZORB becomes a central figure of hope, freedom, and untapped potential — reflecting the ideals of the blockchain community.

The collection features works like:

"Reach for the Zorb" – A girl reaching for the ZORA Zorb instead of a balloon, symbolizing the human desire for innovation and the possibilities of the digital frontier.
"ZORB of Freedom" – A dove flying with a ZORB in its beak, representing the liberation and openness that blockchain technology promises.
"Digital Dreams" – A child holding a glowing ZORB, representing the next generation's embrace of technology and decentralized futures.
Each piece in the collection will be a reminder of how art and technology, though often at odds, can come together to inspire new ways of thinking and seeing the world. For collectors, this represents not just a piece of art, but a symbol of where creativity and innovation meet in the blockchain era.</details> | <details><summary>Link</summary>[Street Meets Crypto: ZORB Revolution](https://opensea.io/collection/street-meets-crypto-zorb-revolution)</details> |
